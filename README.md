# ItChat a discord-like application 

Working web project I created using Django and Python. Works only on your local machine (as of right now) on your **local-machine**. Created it when watching a course on Django.
As of right now I will start evolving this into a bigger project that could be used by a larger audience.

## ü§ñ Deployment 

In order to deploy this project, head on into the folder with all the other folders and main files, especially the one "manage.py".
Down below copy and paste this command into your desired terminal.

```bash

```
Next just ctrl-click the https://127.0.0.1:8000 in the terminal to redirect you to the project.
